# Regular Grammar To Finite Automaton
Console application.
The algorithm reads a grammar from input file, then proceeds to verify if the grammar in question is valid and, if so, verifies if it is regular. If this result is positive, the associated finited automata is created based on the "Regular Grammar to Finite Automaton" algorithm. Afterwards, the user will be given access to a menu in which it can see the input grammmar and can proceed to generate words and verify input words are accepted by the associated finite automata.
